WebTech week 3 assignment
=========================

Fix the security!

**WARNING:** Passwords used by this app are likely to leak! Do **not** use passwords you may be using on other services.

### How to work on the assignment

- *Remix* this project on Glitch.
- Make your cloned project private, by tapping its name in the top left corner and then toggling the lock icon. If you don't do this and other students copy your code, <em>you</em> may get into plagiarism-trouble as well.
- Work on the assignment, right here on Glitch.
- Hand in your work for grading using [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/s6CUNdqaaY8X5o802). You should do this only once and *before* the start of next week's lecture.
- You are allowed to work in pairs, doing [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).


### Requirements

Although this webapp seems to work just fine, it is riddled with security problems. Your task is to fix them, in accordance with best practices. You may only change things when there is a valid security reason to do so.

There are 10 *types* of security problems (that we know of!) in this code, many of them occurring more than once. For each type of problem you found, write instructions on how it could have been exploited in the `documentation.md` file. This file will already contain names for each of the problems, helping you on your way.


### Grading

For each of the 10 types of issues you can earn:

- 2 points for fully and cleanly fixing the problem, or
- 1 point for partly fixing it, or fixing it in an ambigious or overly complicated way,

plus:

- 2 points for giving detailed instructions on how to exploit the problem, and what could be gained by this, or
- 1 point if the instructions are pretty close, but a little vague or not entirely correct.

Points may be deducted for unnecessary changes, especially when they break functionality.

Your grade is simply your total number of points divided by `4`.
